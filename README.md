# 🌌 VibeScape — A Creative Frontend Moodboard

**VibeScape** is a simple and creative frontend-only project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The idea behind VibeScape is to turn your mood into an immersive web experience. You type how you're feeling, and the site gives you:

- 🎬 Mood-based movie suggestions  
- 🎵 Music recommendations via embedded Spotify  
- 📝 Quotes that match the vibe  
- 🎨 Aesthetic visuals to complete the moodboard look

This project is fully UI-based and designed around creativity, emotion, and minimal interaction — with a dreamy black-and-pink theme and smooth animations.
